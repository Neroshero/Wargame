# Wargame
An independent project inspired by the tabletop wargame Warhammer 40k.

# Planed Features
This project will seek to do the following:
1. Have a core gameplay loop involing a turn-based 'battle' between two players that each control an army made up of smaller units, and each unit is made up of individual models.
2. The game concludes after either a set number of turns, or once one player's army is completely destroyed
3. Victory goes to the player who has accumulated the most points by the time the game ends, or, if one player's army is destroyed, victory immediately goes to the other player, regardless of points
4. Players will earn points by completeing objectives assigned to them at the beginning of each turn (look to 40k 8th edition Malestrom of War for inspiration and examples)
5. Each player turn will involve a series of phases, in which each player can undertake actions with their units.
6. The phases will be as follows:
  - Deployment, in which the players simultaniously deploy their armies and an inititive order is decided upon
  - Command, in which the players resolve any beginning of turn effects, and recieve objectives for the turn
  - Movement, in which the players take turns moving units until either all units have been moved, or the player passes on moving
  - Special, in which the players take turns using the special abilities of some units
  - Shooting, in which the players take turns making ranged attacks with the units of their armies
  - Charge, in which the players take turns making special charge moves with their units to attempt to enter melee
  - Melee, in which the players take turns making melee attacks with their units in melee range
  - Morale, in which units that have taken casulties make checks to see if they suffer penalties in the comming turn
  - Scoring, in which the game resolves any end-of-turn changes in points for either player
  - Damage, a special phase that interrupts when needed to resolve the damage done in other phases
7. In addition, each phase will consist of a number of 'speedphases' to state the order in which player units can take their actions, lighter but less dangerous units will move first, while heavier and more dangerous units will move later.
8.  The speedphases will be as follows:
  - speedphase 1: scount infantry
  - speedphase 2: light infantry
  - speedphase 3: light infantry and scout vehicles
  - speedphase 4: medium infantry and light vehicles
  - speedphase 5: heavy infantry and medium vehicles
  - speedphase 6: superheavy infantry and heavy vehicles
  - speedphase 7: superheavy vehicles
9. Before getting into a game with other players, players will be able to build their armies by picking one of four factions, each with their own list of unique units with their own strengths and weaknesses
10. The four factions will be inspired by the four horsement of the apocalypse from the Book of Revelations (Conquest/Pestilance, Famine, War, and Death)
11. In addition, players will be able to build decks for use in the game, one for objectives to be drawn in the command phase, and one for powerfull special abilities that will be unique to each faction, and will have special conditions for use (look at the stratagems in the codexes of army books for 40k 8th edition for examples and inspiration)
